## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In Spain, road accidents remain a significant public safety concern, leading to loss of lives (1.154 people lost their live on inter-urban roads in 2024), injuries (4.634 hospital admissions in 2024), and economic burdens. Despite various measures, predicting and preventing these incidents remains a challenge. This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to identify high-risk scenarios and suggest preventive measures.

By analyzing historical accident data, traffic patterns, weather conditions, and other relevant factors, the project aim is to provide insights into the underlying causes of road sinistrality. These insights will enable authorities to implement targeted interventions, enhance road safety policies, and ultimately reduce the frequency and severity of inter-urban road accidents.

The ultimate goal of the project is to create a safer and more efficient transportation system in Spain, contributing to the well-being of its citizens and the overall improvement of public safety.
   
## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The data used for this project is the [Ficheros microdatos de accidentes con víctimas 2023](https://www.dgt.es/menusecundario/dgt-en-cifras/dgt-en-cifras-resultados/dgt-en-cifras-detalle/Ficheros-microdatos-de-accidentes-con-victimas-2023/) by the Spanish General Traffic Administration ([DGT - Dirección General de Tráfico)](https://www.dgt.es/).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I would like to acknowledge the Spanish General Traffic Administration ([DGT- Dirección General de Tráfico)](https://www.dgt.es/) for publishing so much data in an open way and to allow everyone to explore and study it. It is really an example of how a public entity should manage the access to its data. 

It helped me a lot to develop this project to read [Machine learning predictive model based on national data for fatal accidents of construction workers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580519305151) by Jongko Choi, Bonsung Gu, Sangyoon Chin, Jong-Seok Lee.

Also I would like to acknowledge [Hijmans, Robert J.](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/?f%5Bdct_creator_sm%5D%5B%5D=Hijmans%2C+Robert+J.) for the [polygon shapefile of spanish provinces](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/catalog/stanford-np165yq7060) that I used for the project.
